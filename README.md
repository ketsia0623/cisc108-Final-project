Pitch and Description
Our game is a platformer game that is about a t-rex dinosaur jumping on platforms in order to avoid lava.
The lava(red rectangle taking up the bottom of screen) keeps rising up as the t-rex is moving up the platforms.
There will be obstacles like fire droplets falling down that can reduce the user's score if it touches the 
t-rex. To win, the user needs to have collected a certain amount of points before the lava completely 
rises(timer runs out). If the lava touches the t-rex, the user losses.


Phase 1
- [ ] There is a bouncing t-rex, rising lava, and volcano background
- [ ] The t-rex can jump on top of platforms
- [ ] The t-rex is controlled with the keyboard keys: up, down, left, right & space
- [ ] There is top where the user can reach. 

Phase 2
- [ ] The screen moves up
- [ ] The t-rex dies if it touches the lava
- [ ] There are fire droplets falling down(reduces user score if t-rex touches it) 
- [ ] The t-rex dies if it collides with a falling meteor

Phase 3
- [ ] Make trex moves down with the platformers
- [ ] The score goes up when objects are collected
- [ ] The obstacles make the player lose points or game over
- [ ] The game ends if the t-rex's score isn't high enough
- [ ] The player can customize the character (mermaid, t-rex, snake, fish)

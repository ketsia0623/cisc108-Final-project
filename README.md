Pitch and Description
Our game is a platformer game that is about a mermaid jumping up to reach land.
The screen automatically moves up and the player has to keep up in order to keep
playing. The mermaid can collect items like fish and shells to increase the score while
also avoiding any obstacles that may get in the way. The only way to win the game is to
make it to the top and have a minimum score.

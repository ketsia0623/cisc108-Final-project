Pitch and Description
Our game is a platformer game that is about a t-rex dinosaur jumping on platforms in order to avoid lava.
The lava(red rectangle taking up the bottom of screen) keeps rising up as the t-rex is moving up the platforms.
There will be obstacles like fire droplets falling down that can reduce the user's score if it touches the 
t-rex. To win, the user needs to have collected a certain amount of points before the lava completely 
rises(timer runs out). If the lava touches the t-rex, the user losses. 

collect items like fish and shells to increase the score while
also avoiding any obstacles that may get in the way. The only way to win the game is to
make it to the top and have a minimum score.

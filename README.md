About Section of our Game
Our game is a platformer game about a t-rex dinosaur jumping on platforms in order to avoid lava, as well 
as collect food. The goal of the game is for the user to reach a score of 30 by collecting food items in 
order to win. However, the user will lose if they get a score of -30 instead. While playing, if they are 
able to catch a smaller dinosaur, they automatically win the game. There will be obstacles like fire droplets 
falling down that can reduce the user's score if the t-rex touches it. Additionally, t-rex enlarges itself when 
the game is over and the user tries to keep playing.

Instructions
When our game is first launched, a moving dinosaur t-rex appears. When playing, the left & right keys, 
and the spacebar are used. The spacebar is used to jump and the left and right keys are used to turn left and right.
When the spacebar is double-tapped, it allows the t-rex to jump twice as high. No other keyboard keys are needed to play.

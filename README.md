Pitch and Description
Our game is a platformer game that is about a t-rex dinosaur jumping on platforms in order to avoid lava.
The lava(red rectangle taking up the bottom of screen) keeps rising up as the t-rex is moving up the platforms.
There will be obstacles like fire droplets falling down that can reduce the user's score if it touches the 
t-rex. To win, the user needs to have collected a certain amount of points before the lava completely 
rises(timer runs out). If the lava touches the t-rex, the user loses.
